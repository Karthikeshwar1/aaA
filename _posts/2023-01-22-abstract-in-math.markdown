In mathematics, abstract concepts are those that are not directly observable, but are defined by a set of rules or axioms. These concepts are often used to make mathematical reasoning and problem solving more general, powerful and elegant. Some examples of abstract concepts in mathematics include:

* Sets: A set is a collection of distinct objects, called elements, which are grouped together and treated as a single entity. Sets are used in many areas of mathematics, such as algebra and topology, and form the foundation for the study of abstract algebra.

* Groups: A group is a set of elements and a binary operation that combines two elements of the set to form a third element, and it follows some specific properties. These are used to study symmetry, and are fundamental in several areas like number theory and quantum mechanics.

* Vector spaces: A vector space is a collection of vectors, which are objects that can be added together and scaled. Vector spaces are used in many areas of mathematics, including linear algebra and functional analysis, and are an important tool in physics and engineering.

* Topology: Topology is the study of properties of objects that are preserved under continuous transformations. It is used to study properties of geometric shapes that are unchanged by stretching, bending, and twisting, and it is fundamental in areas like physics, engineering, and computer science.

* Logic: Logic is the study of reasoning, and it is used to analyze the structure of arguments and to formally define the concept of proof. It is the foundation of mathematics, computer science and many other fields.

These are just a few examples of abstract concepts in mathematics, there are many more such as category theory, Galois theory, and so on. Abstract mathematics can be challenging to understand, but it allows for

Anything that is concrete and tangible, and not a concept, idea, or theory that is easy to understand and explain in simple terms.

 They are specific, observable and can be described in terms of their physical characteristics. They are not theoretical, hypothetical or based on ideas, concepts or theories. Examples of things that are not abstract include physical objects such as a chair, a tree, or a rock, as well as observable phenomena like the weather, the movement of a car, or the sound of a bird singing. In general, things that are not abstract are those that can be seen, touched, heard, smelled, or tasted.

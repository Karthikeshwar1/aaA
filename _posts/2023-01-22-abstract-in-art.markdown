In art, the term "abstract" is used to describe a style of painting and sculpture that is characterized by the use of non-representational forms, such as geometric shapes, lines, and colors, to create images that do not depict any recognizable objects or figures. This style of art emerged in the early 20th century as an alternative to representational art, which depicts recognizable objects and figures.

One of the most well-known forms of abstract art is abstract expressionism, which emerged in the 1940s and 1950s in New York City. This movement was defined by its emphasis on the artist's personal expression, the use of large canvases, and the gestural application of paint. Artists like Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Willem de Kooning are considered to be among the most prominent abstract expressionists.

Another important movement in abstract art is minimalism, which emerged in the 1960s. This movement was characterized by the use of simple geometric shapes, often in a limited color palette, and the focus on the physical properties of the materials used. Artists like Donald Judd, Robert Morris, and Sol LeWitt are considered to be among the most prominent minimalists.

In addition to these movements, there are many other forms of abstract art, such as geometric abstraction, color field painting, and conceptual art. All of these movements have in common the use of abstraction and non-representational forms to create a visual language that can evoke emotions and feelings.

Abstract art can be challenging to understand, but it can also be highly evocative and open to multiple interpretations. It encourages the viewer to engage with the work on a more personal, emotional, and intellectual level, and to consider the formal properties of the artwork, such as color, form, and composition.

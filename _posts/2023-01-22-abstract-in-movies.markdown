In the realm of film, the term "abstract" can be used to describe a style of filmmaking that is characterized by non-narrative, experimental, or avant-garde techniques. Abstract films are often non-representational and rely on visual, auditory, and formal elements to create a unique and often non-linear experience for the viewer.

One example of an abstract film is "2001: A Space Odyssey" directed by Stanley Kubrick, which uses abstract imagery, a non-linear narrative, and a minimalistic soundtrack to explore themes of evolution, technology, and artificial intelligence. The film's abstract nature has led to many interpretations and debates about its meaning.

Another example of an abstract film is the work of the Surrealist filmmaker, Luis Buñuel, who often used dream-like imagery and non-linear narrative in his films to create a disorienting and abstract experience for the viewer. In his films, he often used the technique of jump cuts, which is a film editing technique that creates a discontinuity in the film's space-time continuity, that adds to the abstract nature of the film.

Another example of abstract film is the work of Stan Brakhage, an American experimental filmmaker, known for his non-narrative and abstract films. His films often focus on visual and auditory elements such as light, color, and sound to create a unique and often disorienting experience for the viewer.

In contemporary cinema, there are various examples of abstract storytelling, where the filmmaker uses various techniques such as abstract imagery, non-linear narrative, and unconventional storytelling to create a unique and abstract experience for the viewer. Some examples of this include films such as "The Tree of Life" by Terrence Malick, "The Holy Mountain" by Alejandro Jodorowsky, and "Enter the Void" by Gaspar Noé.
